Quick Start Guide
==================

Interactive Gym allows for a streamlined process of converting a Gymnasium (or PettingZoo) environment into an interactive browser-based task. 
All logic to do so is based on the settings of a configuration, which is passed to the Interactive Gym Flask server. 

Configurations are set via the ``RemoteConfig`` class, which contains all configuration options for each experiment.
