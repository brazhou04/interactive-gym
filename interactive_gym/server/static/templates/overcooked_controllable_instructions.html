        You'll be playing a simplified version of the Overcooked video game. Your goal is to collaborate with an AI partner to cook and deliver as many dishes as possible before time runs out.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Here's how the experiment will work.</b> This process will repeat twice on a different layout of the game, for a total of 20 rounds:
        <ol>
            <li>You'll play nine 45-second rounds with an AI partner. After each round, you'll answer a few questions about your partner. The partner you play with will change at each round.</li>
            <li>Then, you'll play a single 45-second round with your choice of partner.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
        Some of the partners you'll be playing with will be controllable by you. You can control the behavior of your partner across two dimensions: delivering dishes or putting onions in the pot.
        You'll have the opportunity to adjust the behaviors at the beginning of each round that you interact with them. The other partners will have fixed behaviors. In some cases, you will be able to observe what 
        they are more inclined to do, but you will not be able to change their behavior. In other cases, you will not be able to observe their behavioral tendencies at all.

        <b>The bonus will be based on a tiered system of achievement.</b>
        <ul>
            <li>If you deliver less than 20 dishes total, you will receive a $0 bonus.</li>
            <li>If you deliver at least 20 dishes total, you will receive a $0.05 bonus per dish delivered. For example, if you deliver exactly 60 dishes, you'll receive a bonus of 60 x $0.05 = $3.00.</li>
        </ul>
        We expect participants who engage in the task to deliver well over 20 dishes total throughout the experiment.
