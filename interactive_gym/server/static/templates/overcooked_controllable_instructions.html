        You'll be playing a simplified version of the Overcooked video game. Your goal is to collaborate with your AI partner to cook and deliver as many dishes as possible before time runs out.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Here's how the experiment will work.</b> This process will repeat twice on a different layout of the game, for a total of 20 rounds:
        <ol>
            <li>You'll play five 45-second rounds with an AI partner. After each round, you'll answer a few questions about your partner.</li>
            <li>Then, you'll play another five 45-second rounds with a different AI partner. Again, after each round, you'll answer a few questions about your partner.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
        One of the partners you'll be playing with is controllable by you. You can control the behavior of your partner across three dimensions: delivering dishes, putting onions in the pot, and plating dishes.
        You'll have the opportunity to adjust the behaviors throughout the 5 rounds that you interact with that partner. The other partner will have fixed behaviors, and you will be able to observe what 
        they are more inclined to do, but you will not be able to change their behavior.

        <b>The bonus will be based on a tiered system of achievement.</b>
        <ul>
            <li>If you deliver less than 30 dishes total, you will receive a $0 bonus.</li>
            <li>If you deliver at least 30 dishes total, you will receive $0.02 per dish delivered. This means that if you deliver 30 dishes, you'll receive a bonus of 30 x $0.02 = $0.60.</li>
            <li>If you deliver at least 60 dishes total, you will receive a $0.05 bonus per dish delivered. For example, if you deliver exactly 60 dishes, you'll receive a bonus of 60 x $0.05 = $3.00.</li>
        </ul>
        We expect participants who engage in the task to deliver well over 60 dishes total throughout the experiment.
