    You'll be playing a simplified version of the Overcooked video gamewith AI partners, and your goal is to cook and deliver as many dishes as possible before time runs out.

    Here's how the experiment will work:
    <ol>
        <li>You'll play one 35-second round with an AI partner.</li>
        <li>Then, you'll play another 35-second round with a different AI partner.</li>
        <li>After these two rounds, you'll indicate which partner you preferred and provide an evaluation of the partners.</li>
        <li>This process will repeat 10 times, with different game layouts and AI partners each time.</li>
    </ol>
</p>

<p>
    In total, you'll play 20 rounds. For each dish delivered (by you or your partner), you'll receive a $0.04 bonus. You'll be able to earn up to a $6.00 bonus. 
    Remember, you must actively participate to earn a bonus and the game will pause if you navigate to another application or window.
