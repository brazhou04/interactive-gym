    You'll be playing a simplified version of the Overcooked video game. Your goal is to collaborate with your AI partner to cook and deliver as many dishes as possible before time runs out.

    Here's how the experiment will work:
    <ol>
        <li>You'll play one 45-second round with an AI partner.</li>
        <li>Then, you'll play another 45-second round with a different AI partner.</li>
        <li>After these two rounds, you'll indicate which partner you preferred and provide an evaluation of the partners.</li>
        <li>This process will repeat 10 times, with different game layouts and AI partners each time.</li>
    </ol>

    The bonus will be based on a tiered system of achievement:
    <ul>
        <li>If you deliver less than 30 dishes total, you will receive a $0 bonus.</li>
        <li>If you deliver at least 30 dishes total, you will receive $0.02 per dish delivered. This means that if you deliver 30 dishes, you'll receive a bonus of 30 x $0.02 = $0.60.</li>
        <li>If you deliver at least 60 dishes total, you will receive a $0.05 bonus per dish delivered. For example, if you deliver exactly 60 dishes, you'll receive a bonus of 60 x $0.05 = $3.00.</li>
    </ul>
    We expect participants who engage in the task to deliver well over 60 dishes total throughout the experiment.
