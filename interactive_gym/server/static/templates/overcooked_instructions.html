    You will be playing a simple version of the Overcooked video game with an AI partner. The goal of the game is to cook and deliver as many dishes as possible before time runs out. In the main portion of this task, you will play a single round of the game with one partner, then your partner will be switched to a different one. After interacting with the second partner, you will indicate your preference between the two. This process will be repeated 10 times with a varying set of environment layouts. </p>

<p>
    To cook a dish, you must collect three onions from the onion pile, one by one, and place them in the pot. Once three onions are placed in the pot, a timer will begin counting down. When it reaches zero, you must retrieve a plate, retrieve the cooked soup from the pot, and deliver it to the delivery area. Each delivered dish will give you and your partner one point. To maximize the number of points, you must coordinate your behavior to efficiently complete each step in the cooking process.

<p>
    An example is shown below. There is the pot with two onions in it on the top, onion piles on the left and right sides, a plate stack on the bottom left, and the delivery zone in the bottom right.

    You will control the chef with the blue hat. Use the arrow keys to move your character. To pick up an object, you must approach it and be facing the object and press the W key on your keyboard. This is also used for dropping an object or placing onions in the pot: when youâ€™re holding an object, press W to drop it. To deliver a dish, drop the dish into the delivery area.
</p>

<p>
    In total, you will play 20 rounds of the game which are 35 seconds each. You will review a bonus of $0.04 for each dish delivered. To earn any bonus, you must be actively contributing in the game. </p>

         You will first be directed to a brief training round where you will complete a round of the task alone. Note that deliveries in this training round do not count towards the bonus for the task.
